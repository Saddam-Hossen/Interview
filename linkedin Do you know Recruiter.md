Great question — here’s a clear breakdown:

---

## ✅ Do All Companies Have Their Own Recruiters?

### 🏢 **Large and Mid-Size Companies**

✅ **Yes**, they usually have **in-house recruiters** (also called Talent Acquisition Specialists or HR Recruiters).
These recruiters:

* Work **directly for the company**
* Hire for full-time or contract roles
* Post jobs on LinkedIn, company career pages, and job boards
* Often handle technical hiring (e.g., Java Developers)

**Examples**:

* Capgemini, TCS, Cognizant, EPAM, Google → all have internal recruiters

---

### 🤝 **Staffing/Consulting Companies**

✅ **Yes**, but these recruiters hire **for their clients** (not their own company).

They:

* Source candidates for client companies (banks, product teams, etc.)
* Place contractors or permanent employees on client projects
* Often work **internationally** (e.g., remote jobs in the USA, Canada)

**Examples**:

* Crossover, Turing, X-Team, Toptal, Robert Half

---

### 🚀 **Startups / Small Companies**

❌ May **not have full-time recruiters**.
Instead:

* Hiring is done by the **founder**, **CTO**, or **Team Lead**
* Or they use **external recruiters or freelance platforms** (like Upwork, AngelList, Arc.dev)

---

## 🎯 What Does This Mean for You?

When job hunting:

1. **Connect with both:**

   * **Company Recruiters** (for jobs at one company)
   * **Agency Recruiters** (for jobs across multiple clients)

2. **Search LinkedIn for roles like:**

   * *Java Technical Recruiter*
   * *Talent Acquisition Java*
   * *Remote Developer Hiring Manager*
   * Add filters: “Remote” + “Hiring” + “Java” + Target Country

3. **Also message Tech Leads or Developers**

   * Sometimes THEY refer candidates to their internal recruiter
