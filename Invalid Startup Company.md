If you're dealing with a **startup company** and want to verify whether it's **legit and trustworthy**, here’s a **step-by-step checklist** to confirm their authenticity — especially important before applying, sharing personal info, or accepting a job offer:

---

## ✅ How to Verify a Startup Company

---

### 🔹 1. **Check Their LinkedIn Company Page**

* Do they have a **LinkedIn company page**?
* Do they have **real employees listed** under the “People” tab?
* Do they **post updates**, hiring news, or project highlights?
* Is the founder/CEO on LinkedIn with a **complete profile**?

📌 Example:

* Go to LinkedIn → Search for the company → Click their logo (🏢) → Review "About", "People", "Jobs", "Posts"

---

### 🔹 2. **Search for Their Website**

* Do they have a **professional website** (not just a landing page)?
* Does it include:

  * Company mission / product info?
  * Careers or jobs page?
  * Address or team page?
* Check the **domain age** using [who.is](https://who.is/) to see if it’s newly registered (suspicious if <6 months)

---

### 🔹 3. **Search for Online Presence Outside LinkedIn**

* Google:

  ```
  [Company Name] + reviews
  [Company Name] + scam
  [Company Name] + funding / Crunchbase
  ```
* Check for:

  * Media coverage or blog posts
  * Listings on AngelList/Wellfound, Crunchbase, Y Combinator, ProductHunt
  * Glassdoor or Indeed reviews
  * GitHub organization or apps they built

---

### 🔹 4. **Check Company Registration (Optional)**

* In **India**: Use [MCA.gov.in](https://www.mca.gov.in)
* In **US**: Use [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com)
* In **Bangladesh**: Use RJSC portal or ask for Trade License
* In **UK**: Use [Companies House](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/)

---

### 🔹 5. **Check the Founders or CTO**

* Do they have complete, real LinkedIn profiles?
* Have they worked at known companies before?
* Are they posting content or replying to comments?
* Do they show up in other platforms like GitHub, Twitter, ProductHunt?

---

### 🔹 6. **Review Their Job Offer Process**

Red flags if:

* They offer jobs **without interviews or technical tests**
* Ask you to pay any **training or onboarding fees**
* Ask for **passport or banking info too early**
* Offer **very high salaries** with **zero technical questions**

---

### 🔹 7. **Check GitHub, Product Pages, or Clients**

* Does the company have:

  * Open-source repos on GitHub?
  * An active product?
  * Listed clients or testimonials?

---

## 🚨 Red Flags

❌ No employees or fake profiles
❌ No external presence (Google, GitHub, press)
❌ Asking for money or crypto upfront
❌ Gmail or Yahoo email address for hiring
❌ Poor English or vague job descriptions

---

## ✅ Pro Tip:

If you’re unsure, **ask directly**:

> “I’d love to learn more about your company’s work and remote team structure. Can you share your company site, GitHub link, or any product showcase?”

If they hesitate or avoid answering, that's a red flag.
