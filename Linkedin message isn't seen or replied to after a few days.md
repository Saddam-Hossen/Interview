If your message **isn't seen or replied to** after a few days, don’t worry — this is common on LinkedIn, especially with busy recruiters.

Here’s exactly what to do:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: If Message is Not Seen

### ⏱️ Wait 4–6 Days

Give them time. They may be busy, traveling, or reviewing other messages.

---

## 🔁 Then: Send a **Polite Follow-Up Message**

Here’s a follow-up you can send:

```text
Hi Alfredo,  
Just wanted to follow up on my earlier message. I’m really interested in any **remote Java Developer** opportunities at Capgemini (or with your clients).  

Happy to share my resume or portfolio if needed.  
Thanks again and wishing you a great week ahead!  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
```

### 👀 Tips:

* Don’t spam or send again too soon.
* Don’t ask “Did you see my message?” — instead, rephrase like above.
* Be patient. Sometimes they reply **weeks later**.

## 🚨 If Still No Reply After Follow-Up?

Try these:

1. **Like or comment** on their recent posts to stay on their radar.
2. Look for **another recruiter at Capgemini** and connect + message.
3. Apply directly via:

   * [Capgemini Careers](https://www.capgemini.com/careers/)
   * [LinkedIn Jobs](https://linkedin.com/jobs)
   * \[Toptal, Upwork, or Arc.dev] if they hire through those platforms

Would you like me to:

* Write a version with your **GitHub or resume link** included?
* Draft follow-up messages for **other recruiters** too?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed — I’ll support you all the way.
