* ✅ Hire international developers quickly
* ✅ Focus more on **skills and project proof**, not just degrees or location
* ✅ Offer flexible, remote-friendly environments
* ✅ Don’t have huge hiring pipelines — so **personal contact works well**

### ✅ 2. **Craft a Strong Direct Outreach Message**

Startups love devs who take initiative. So message **founders**, **CTOs**, or **team leads** directly on LinkedIn or company email.

#### 📩 Example Message to Startup Founder/CTO:

```text
Hi [Name],  
I came across [Startup Name] and loved your product — especially [specific feature or goal].  

I’m a Full Stack Java Developer from Bangladesh with 4+ years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, and React. I’m currently exploring **remote opportunities**, and would love to contribute to a startup like yours.  

Happy to share my GitHub, resume, or complete a trial task. Looking forward to connecting!

Best,  
[Your Name]
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Build a Micro Portfolio That Impresses Startups**

Startup CTOs don’t read long resumes — they want to **see what you can build**.

Include:

* 1–2 Java + React full stack projects (hosted on Netlify, Render, or Vercel)
* Real-world features like login, API, DB
* Clean GitHub repo with README
* Bonus: A simple "demo video" explaining your project

I can help design this if you want — just say the word.

---

### ✅ 4. **Join Startup Communities & Job Boards**

| Community                                                                                           | Benefit                                         |

### ✅ 5. **Build a One-Page Developer Website**

Create a quick personal site using:

* GitHub Pages
* Netlify
* Hashnode.dev or Dev.to profile

Include:

* About Me + Skills
* Project links
* Contact info

This works as your **portfolio + resume in one**.

---

### ✅ 6. **Offer to Do a Trial Task (Optional)**

Startups often appreciate when you say:

> “Happy to do a small paid trial project to prove my skills.”

It builds trust and can lead to a long-term remote contract.
