Absolutely — **Step 5: Build Strategic Connections** is one of the *most powerful but underused* ways to land **remote jobs via LinkedIn**, especially for international candidates like you in **Bangladesh**.

Let’s break it down into clear sub-steps:

---

### ✅ Why Is Strategic Networking Important?

Most remote jobs are filled **before they're even posted publicly**.

By connecting with the **right people**, you:

* Get **early access** to job openings
* Receive **referrals** (increases your hiring chance by 9×)
* Build trust despite not being in their country

### 🧠 Who Should You Connect With?

Build a focused LinkedIn network in your **target countries** (USA, Germany, UK, etc.):

| Role                                                       | Examples                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Recruiters**                                             | "Technical Recruiter at Capgemini", "Java Hiring Manager at Turing"      |
| **CTOs / Tech Leads**                                      | “CTO at XYZ Tech” or “Engineering Manager – Remote”                      |
| **Java Developers working remotely**                       | Especially if they’re from Bangladesh or similar background              |
| **People hiring on platforms like Toptal, Turing, Upwork** | “Talent Acquisition – Turing” or “Remote Engineering Team Lead – X-Team” |

1. **Thank them**: “Thanks for connecting! I admire your work at \[Company].”

2. **Add value**:

   * Comment on their posts
   * Share your own Java projects
   * Ask thoughtful questions like:

     > "Do you recommend any platform or recruiter that hires Java devs remotely?"

3. **Ask for opportunities or referrals (after 1-2 interactions):**

   If you know of any team hiring or can refer me, I’d be super grateful!
