## ✅ Step-by-Step: How to Check If a Company is Legit on LinkedIn

### 🔎 1. **Search the Company Name**

* Go to [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)
* Use the **search bar** → type the **company name**
* Click on the result with the **🏢 building icon** labeled “Company”

---

### ✅ 2. **Check These Key Details on the Company Page**

| What to Check                  | Why It Matters                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Logo + Banner**              | A real company usually has branding (not just a blank logo)              |
| **Company Size**               | Look for realistic ranges (e.g., 11–50, 51–200)                          |
| **Website Link**               | Click to check if the site is active and professional                    |
| **About Section**              | Should describe what the company does, industry, location                |
| **Location Info**              | Real companies show actual office locations or headquarters              |
| **Employee Count on LinkedIn** | Check "X employees on LinkedIn" → click to see if real people are listed |
| **Job Postings**               | See if they post jobs regularly; scams often don’t post real jobs        |
| **Activity / Posts**           | Legit companies often post updates, news, or hiring notices              |
| **Founders or CEO Profile**    | Look at leadership: do they have real profiles connected to the company? |

### 🚩 Red Flags (Scam or Fake Company)

* No logo, no banner
* No employees listed
* No company website or a broken URL
* Very new company with **no activity or content**
* Unrealistic promises (e.g., “100% guaranteed job” or “pay to get hired”)
* Founders with empty or fake-looking profiles

---

## 🔍 Pro Tip: Google It Too

Search:

```
[Company Name] site:linkedin.com
[Company Name] Glassdoor reviews
[Company Name] scam or review
```

---

## 💬 Example — Check This:

Let’s say you search for: `ProLegion`

* ✅ You'll find a **LinkedIn page** with logo, website, description, and listed employees.
* ✅ You can **see job posts**, like “Java Developer (Remote)”
* ✅ Their employees have **legit LinkedIn profiles**
  → So it's a **real company**
