Great question! 🤝 After someone **accepts your LinkedIn connection**, your next message is **very important** — it should be polite, clear, and based on **who they are** and **what you want** (job lead, advice, referral, etc.).

Below are message templates tailored for each type of person you're connecting with:

---

## 🔹 1. **Recruiters** (After they accept your request)

### 🔧 Goal: Show you're available, share your profile, and ask about roles.

```text
Hi [Name],  
Thanks for accepting my connection! I’m a Full Stack Java Developer from Bangladesh with 4+ years of experience in Spring Boot, React, and REST APIs.  

I’m actively looking for **remote opportunities** and would love to hear if your team is hiring for any backend or full stack Java roles (contract or full-time).  

Happy to share my CV or GitHub portfolio if helpful. Thanks again! 🙌  
```

## 🔹 2. **CTOs / Tech Leads**

### 🔧 Goal: Introduce yourself + express interest in their team or product.
