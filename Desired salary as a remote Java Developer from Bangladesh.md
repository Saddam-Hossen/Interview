## ⚠️ Don’t Undersell Yourself

Many developers from Bangladesh **ask too little** (like \$800–\$1200/month), which makes recruiters assume:

* You’re junior or not confident
* You don’t know international rates
* You won’t deliver like global devs

Instead, **quote your value confidently**, and back it up with:

* Your GitHub / portfolio
* Clear English communication
* Experience working independently
